    <h1>A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</h1>
    <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate.<br>
       That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p>
    <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor.<br>
       More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p>
    <p><strong>Netleafa introduces a different approach.</strong></p>
    <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system
       designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p>
    <p>You lay it down.<br>
       Time does the work.<br>
       When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY -->
  <section id="why">
    <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="divider" class="divider">
    <h2>The problem is bigger than leaves.</h2>
    <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p>
    <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles.<br>
       Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil.<br>
       Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p>
    <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.<br>
       Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p>
    <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.<br>
       Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p>
    <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands
       instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p>
    <p>One system.<br>One motion.<br>Less effort overall.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW -->
  <section id="how">
    <h2>Passive by design. Effective by nature.</h2>
    <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p>
    <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.<br>
       Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.<br>
       As debris falls, it stays on top.<br>
       Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together
       without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p>
    <p>When the season or interval is complete:</p>
    <ul class="centered-bullets">
      <li>Stakes are removed</li>
      <li>The net is gathered from the edges</li>
      <li>Debris is removed in one controlled motion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No engines. No constant labor. No repeated cleanup cycles.<br>
       The system works quietly in the background.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- MANIFESTO -->
  <section id="manifesto">
    <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="divider" class="divider">
    <h2>How we think about the ground beneath us.</h2>
    <p>For decades, we have treated these natural cycles as problems to chase
       instead of systems to manage.</p>
    <p>Netleafa was built on a simpler idea.<br>
       What if the ground could do more of the work itself?</p>
    <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting, we created a passive way to catch what falls.</p>
    <p>No engines. No urgency. No constant intervention.</p>
    <p>But Netleafa is not only about cleanup.<br>
       It is about rethinking how we interact with the ground.<br>
       How we seed it. How we protect it. How we maintain it across seasons.</p>
    <p>The same system that captures debris can support growth.<br>
       The same process that simplifies cleanup can simplify care.<br>
       The same infrastructure can adapt without changing how people work.</p>
    <p>We believe the best systems are quiet.<br>
       That the most useful tools become habits.<br>
       And that progress often comes from removing friction, not adding complexity.</p>
    <p>Netleafa is meant to be used, removed, and used again.<br>
       A cycle that mirrors nature instead of fighting it.</p>
    <p>Catch what falls.<br>And rethink what comes next.</p>

    <h2>A repeat-use platform built on simplicity, habit, and local scale.</h2>
    <p>Netleafa is designed around one fundamental shift.<br>
       Instead of chasing debris after it falls, capture it as it lands.</p>
    <p>That shift unlocks more than convenience.<br>
       It creates a repeat-use system, predictable demand, and a foundation for an entirely
       new category of ground management.</p>
