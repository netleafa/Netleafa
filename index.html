      <h2>A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</h2>

      <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate.
That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p>

      <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor.
More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p>

      <p>Netleafa introduces a different approach.</p>

      <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p>

      <p>You lay it down.
Time does the work.
When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p>

      <h1>The problem is bigger than leaves.</h1>

      <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p>

      <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles.
Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil.
Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p>

      <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.</p>

      <p>Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p>

      <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.</p>

      <p>Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p>

      <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p>

      <p>One system.
One motion.
Less effort overall.</p>

      <h1>Passive by design. Effective by nature.</h1>

      <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p>

      <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.</p>

      <p>Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.</p>

      <p>As debris falls, it stays on top.</p>

      <p>Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p>

      <p>When the season or interval is complete:
• Stakes are removed
• The net is gathered from the edges
• Debris is removed in one controlled motion</p>

      <p>No engines.
No constant labor.
No repeated cleanup cycles.</p>

      <p>The system works quietly in the background.</p>

      <h1>How we think about the ground beneath us.</h1>

      <p>For decades, we have treated these natural cycles as problems to chase instead of systems to manage.</p>

      <p>Netleafa was built on a simpler idea.
What if the ground could do more of the work itself?</p>

      <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting, we created a passive way to catch what falls.</p>

      <p>No engines. No urgency. No constant intervention.</p>

      <p>But Netleafa is not only about cleanup.</p>

      <p>It is about rethinking how we interact with the ground.</p>

      <p>How we seed it.
How we protect it.
How we maintain it across seasons.</p>

      <p>The same system that captures debris can support growth.</p>

      <p>The same process that simplifies cleanup can simplify care.</p>

      <p>The same infrastructure can adapt without changing how people work.</p>

      <p>We believe the best systems are quiet.
That the most useful tools become habits.
And that progress often comes from removing friction, not adding complexity.</p>

      <p>Netleafa is meant to be used, removed, and used again.</p>

      <p>A cycle that mirrors nature instead of fighting it.</p>

      <p>Catch what falls.
And rethink what comes next.</p>

      <h1>A repeat-use platform built on simplicity, habit, and local scale.</h1>

      <p>Netleafa is designed around one fundamental shift.</p>

      <p>Instead of chasing debris after it falls, capture it as it lands.</p>

      <p>That shift unlocks more than convenience.
It creates a repeat-use system, predictable demand, and a foundation for an entirely new category of ground management.</p>
