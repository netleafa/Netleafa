    <h2>A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</h2>

    <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate.<br>
    That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p>

    <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor.<br>
    More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p>

    <p>Netleafa introduces a different approach.</p>

    <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p>

    <p>You lay it down.<br>
    Time does the work.<br>
    When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p>

    <h1>The problem is bigger than leaves.</h1>

    <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p>

    <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles.<br>
    Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil.<br>
    Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p>

    <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.</p>

    <p>Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p>

    <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.</p>

    <p>Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p>

    <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p>

    <p>One system.<br>
    One motion.<br>
    Less effort overall.</p>

    <h1>Passive by design. Effective by nature.</h1>

    <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p>

    <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.</p>

    <p>Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.</p>

    <p>As debris falls, it stays on top.</p>

    <p>Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p>

    <p>When the season or interval is complete:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stakes are removed</li>
      <li>The net is gathered from the edges</li>
      <li>Debris is removed in one controlled motion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No engines.<br>
    No constant labor.<br>
    No repeated cleanup cycles.</p>

    <p>The system works quietly in the background.</p>
