    <p class="light">A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</p>

    <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate.<br>
    That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p>

    <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor.<br>
    More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p>

    <p class="medium bold">Netleafa introduces a different approach.</p>

    <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p>

    <p>You lay it down.<br>
    Time does the work.<br>
    When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p>

  <section id="why" class="section">
    <p class="medium">The problem is bigger than leaves.</p>

    <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p>

    <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles.<br>
    Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil.<br>
    Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p>

    <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.</p>

    <p>Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p>

    <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.</p>

    <p class="medium">Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p>

    <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p>

    <p>One system.<br>
    One motion.<br>
    Less effort overall.</p>

  <section id="how" class="section">
    <p class="medium">Passive by design. Effective by nature.</p>

    <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p>

    <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.</p>

    <p>Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.</p>

    <p>As debris falls, it stays on top.</p>

    <p>Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p>

    <p class="medium">When the season or interval is complete:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stakes are removed</li>
      <li>The net is gathered from the edges</li>
      <li>Debris is removed in one controlled motion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No engines.<br>
    No constant labor.<br>
    No repeated cleanup cycles.</p>

    <p>The system works quietly in the background.</p>

  <section id="manifesto" class="section">
    <p class="medium">How we think about the ground beneath us.</p>

    <p>For decades, we have treated these natural cycles as problems to chase instead of systems to manage.</p>

    <p class="medium">Netleafa was built on a simpler idea.<br>
    What if the ground could do more of the work itself?</p>

    <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting, we created a passive way to catch what falls.</p>

    <p>No engines. No urgency. No constant intervention.</p>

    <p class="medium">But Netleafa is not only about cleanup.</p>

    <p>It is about rethinking how we interact with the ground.</p>

    <p>How we seed it.<br>
    How we protect it.<br>
    How we maintain it across seasons.</p>

    <p>The same system that captures debris can support growth.</p>

    <p>The same process that simplifies cleanup can simplify care.</p>

    <p>The same infrastructure can adapt without changing how people work.</p>

    <p>We believe the best systems are quiet.<br>
    That the most useful tools become habits.<br>
    And that progress often comes from removing friction, not adding complexity.</p>

    <p>Netleafa is meant to be used, removed, and used again.</p>

    <p>A cycle that mirrors nature instead of fighting it.</p>

    <p class="medium">Catch what falls.<br>
    And rethink what comes next.</p>

  <section id="invest" class="section">
    <p class="medium">A repeat-use platform built on simplicity, habit, and local scale.</p>

    <p>Netleafa is designed around one fundamental shift.</p>

    <p class="medium">Instead of chasing debris after it falls, capture it as it lands.</p>

    <p>That shift unlocks more than convenience.<br>
    It creates a repeat-use system, predictable demand, and a foundation for an entirely new category of ground management.</p>

    <p class="medium">More than debris removal</p>

    <p>Debris capture is the entry point, not the ceiling.</p>

    <p>The same netting system can be adapted to carry additional functions without changing how users interact with it.</p>

    <p class="medium">Future applications include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seed-loaded netting for lawn seeding and repair</li>
      <li>Fertilizer-integrated netting for controlled nutrient delivery</li>
      <li>Ground suppression netting for lawn removal or transition</li>
      <li>Salt-loaded netting for winter ice control on sidewalks, paths, and managed surfaces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each application follows the same behavior: Lay it down. Let it work. Remove it.</p>

    <p>One system. Multiple seasons. No retraining required.</p>

    <p class="medium">The opportunity</p>

    <p>Netleafa is not a single product launch.</p>

    <p>It is the foundation of a new category focused on passive ground management across residential, commercial, and municipal environments.</p>

    <p>What starts with catching what falls expands into how the ground is seeded, maintained, protected, and managed year-round.</p>

    <p>This is not lawn care.<br>
    It is ground infrastructure.</p>
