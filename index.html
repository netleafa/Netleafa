<section id="intro" class="reveal"> <img src="assets/tree_f4f3f2.svg" alt="Netleafa" class="tree-logo"> <h2>A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</h2> <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate. That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p> <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor. More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p> <p>Netleafa introduces a different approach.</p> <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p> <p>You lay it down. Time does the work. When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p> <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="" class="divider"> <a href="#top" class="return-link">Index</a> </section>

<section id="why" class="reveal"> <h2>The problem is bigger than leaves.</h2> <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p> <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles. Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil. Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p> <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.</p> <p>Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p> <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.</p> <p>Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p> <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p> <p>One system. One motion. Less effort overall.</p> <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="" class="divider"> <a href="#top" class="return-link">Index</a> </section>

<section id="how" class="reveal"> <h2>Passive by design. Effective by nature.</h2> <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p> <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.</p> <p>Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.</p> <div class="slideshow-container"> <img src="assets/Phase1.png" class="slide active" alt="Phase 1"> <img src="assets/Phase2.png" class="slide" alt="Phase 2"> <img src="assets/Phase3.png" class="slide" alt="Phase 3"> </div> <p>As debris falls, it stays on top.</p> <p>Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p> <p>When the season or interval is complete:</p> <div class="bullet-wrapper"> <ul> <li>Stakes are removed</li> <li>The net is gathered from the edges</li> <li>Debris is removed in one controlled motion</li> </ul> </div> <p>No engines. No constant labor. No repeated cleanup cycles.</p> <p>The system works quietly in the background.</p> <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="" class="divider"> <a href="#top" class="return-link">Index</a> </section>

<section id="manifesto" class="reveal"> <h3>MANIFESTO</h3> <h2>How we think about the ground beneath us.</h2> <p>For decades, we have treated these natural cycles as problems to chase instead of systems to manage.</p> <p>Netleafa was built on a simpler idea. What if the ground could do more of the work itself?</p> <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting, we created a passive way to catch what falls.</p> <p>No engines. No urgency. No constant intervention.</p> <p>But Netleafa is not only about cleanup.</p> <p>It is about rethinking how we interact with the ground.</p> <p>How we seed it. How we protect it. How we maintain it across seasons.</p> <p>The same system that captures debris can support growth.</p> <p>The same process that simplifies cleanup can simplify care.</p> <p>The same infrastructure can adapt without changing how people work.</p> <p>We believe the best systems are quiet. That the most useful tools become habits. And that progress often comes from removing friction, not adding complexity.</p> <p>Netleafa is meant to be used, removed, and used again.</p> <p>A cycle that mirrors nature instead of fighting it.</p> <p>Catch what falls. And rethink what comes next.</p> <img src="assets/divider.svg" alt="" class="divider"> <a href="#top" class="return-link">Index</a> </section>

<section id="invest" class="reveal"> <h3>INVEST</h3> <h2>A repeat-use platform built on simplicity, habit, and local scale.</h2> <p>Netleafa is designed around one fundamental shift.</p> <p>Instead of chasing debris after it falls, capture it as it lands.</p> <p>That shift unlocks more than convenience. It creates a repeat-use system, predictable demand, and a foundation for an entirely new category of ground management.</p>
