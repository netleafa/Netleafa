  <h1>A simpler way to manage what naturally collects on the ground.</h1>

  <p>Leaves fall. Seeds drop. Acorns land. Pine needles accumulate.</p>
  <p>That is simply how outdoor environments work.</p>

  <p>For decades, we have responded with noise, fuel, plastic bags, and repeated labor.</p>
  <p>More effort than necessary. More waste than makes sense.</p>

  <p>Netleafa introduces a different approach.</p>

  <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting methods, Netleafa is a passive ground-capture system designed to collect natural debris before it becomes work.</p>

  <p>You lay it down.<br>
  Time does the work.<br>
  When you are ready, you roll it up and move on.</p>

</section>

<section id="why" class="section">

  <h2>The problem is bigger than leaves.</h2>

  <p>Leaves are only part of what falls.</p>

  <p>Acorns damage equipment and injure ankles.<br>
  Pine needles embed themselves into turf and soil.<br>
  Seeds, pods, and organic debris collect unevenly and resist raking.</p>

  <p>Traditional cleanup methods struggle with this material.</p>

  <p>Blowers scatter it. Rakes miss it. Vacuum systems clog or require repeated passes.</p>

  <p>The work becomes louder, messier, and more expensive every season.</p>

  <p>Netleafa captures everything that falls by addressing the problem earlier.</p>

  <p>By placing a thin net directly on the ground, debris is collected as it lands instead of being chased afterward. Shape, size, and density no longer matter.</p>

  <p>One system.<br>
  One motion.<br>
  Less effort overall.</p>

  <h2>Passive by design. Effective by nature.</h2>

  <p>Netleafa is a thin, biodegradable netting system made from hemp fibers.</p>

  <p>The net is laid directly on lawns, fields, or managed ground and staked flat.</p>

  <p>Openings allow sunlight, water, and air to reach the surface below.</p>

  <p>As debris falls, it stays on top.</p>

  <p>Leaves, acorns, pine needles, seed pods, and organic material are captured together without blowing, raking, or vacuuming.</p>

  <p>When the season or interval is complete:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Stakes are removed</li>
    <li>The net is gathered from the edges</li>
    <li>Debris is removed in one controlled motion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No engines.<br>
  No constant labor.<br>
  No repeated cleanup cycles.</p>

  <p>The system works quietly in the background.</p>

<section id="manifesto" class="section">

  <h2>How we think about the ground beneath us.</h2>

  <p>For decades, we have treated these natural cycles as problems to chase instead of systems to manage.</p>

  <p>Netleafa was built on a simpler idea.<br>
  What if the ground could do more of the work itself?</p>

  <p>Inspired by agricultural harvesting, we created a passive way to catch what falls.</p>

  <p>No engines. No urgency. No constant intervention.</p>

  <p>But Netleafa is not only about cleanup.</p>

  <p>It is about rethinking how we interact with the ground.</p>

  <p>How we seed it.<br>
  How we protect it.<br>
  How we maintain it across seasons.</p>

  <p>The same system that captures debris can support growth.</p>

  <p>The same process that simplifies cleanup can simplify care.</p>

  <p>The same infrastructure can adapt without changing how people work.</p>

  <p>We believe the best systems are quiet.<br>
  That the most useful tools become habits.<br>
  And that progress often comes from removing friction, not adding complexity.</p>

  <p>Netleafa is meant to be used, removed, and used again.</p>

  <p>A cycle that mirrors nature instead of fighting it.</p>

  <p>Catch what falls.<br>
  And rethink what comes next.</p>

  <h2>A repeat-use platform built on simplicity, habit, and local scale.</h2>

  <p>Netleafa is designed around one fundamental shift.</p>

  <p>Instead of chasing debris after it falls, capture it as it lands.</p>

  <p>That shift unlocks more than convenience.<br>
  It creates a repeat-use system, predictable demand, and a foundation for an entirely new category of ground management.</p>

  <h2>A product that becomes a habit</h2>

  <p>Netleafa is sticky by design.</p>

  <p>Once users experience passive ground capture, they do not return to traditional cleanup methods. The benefit is immediate and obvious. Less labor. Less mess. Less time spent managing a problem that repeats every year.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Netleafa is not meant to be permanent.</p>

  <p>The net cannot be left down indefinitely. Over time it will restrict growth and naturally begin to break down. This is intentional.</p>

  <p>Netleafa is designed to be applied, used, removed, and reapplied.</p>

  <p>That cycle matters.</p>

  <p>It creates a tool people plan around season after season.</p>

  <p>A default solution.</p>

  <p>A product that becomes part of routine maintenance rather than a one-time purchase.</p>

  <p>This repeat-use behavior drives long-term value without subscriptions or forced lock-in.</p>
